# BatchCorrupter
This is a script originally made when I was like... 14? I've recently found it and i'm just poking at it,
adding new features or cleaning up some code or making sure the script still works on everything from Python 2.5 to 3.10.
The original purpose of this was to be able to do ROM corruption across an entire folder of ROMs instead of individually, 
so it's not really of much use to anyone but little old me. If you can find one, I'd love to know about it!

This code is bad, but hey, I was 14. Don't get me wrong, my new code is still awful, but i'm very, very slowly improving.
